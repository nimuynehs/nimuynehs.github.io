<p> Knot theory
  <br>
  <a href="files/knotpre-Presentation-7-3-2023.pdf"> Alternating knots and Tait Conjecture: An application of Jones’s Polynomial</a>
    <br>
    Gave a presentation on alternating knots and Tait conjecture as an application of Jones Polynomial.
    <br>
  <a href="files/Knot_pre_2.pdf"> Some algebraic structures of links: from 0 to ε</a>
    <br>
    Gave a self-contained presentation on the braid group and its representation in Temperley-Lieb algebra, and get Jones polynomial in an algebraic way.

<p> Model theory
    <br>
  <a href="files/AG.pdf"> Final Project</a>
    <br>
    Proved Ax-Grothendick using a model theory approach.
</p>
<p> Applied Math
  <br>
  <a href="files/math703.pdf"> Geometry of Classical Dynamics</a>
  <br>
    This was the final project for Math 703 at the University of Wisconsin--Madison, where we introduced the fundamental geometrical concepts modeling classical mechanics such as manifolds, tangent spaces, cotangent spaces, Riemannian metrics, Lie derivatives, covariant derivatives, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, their corresponding concepts in physics, and their applications.

<p> DRP
  <br>
  <a href="files/DRP presentation.pdf"> The invariant subspace problem</a>
  <br>
  Gave a presentation on Banach space, bounded linear operator, compact operator, Banach algebra, spectrum of a bounded linear operator, spectral radius formula, eigenvalue of a compact operator, and the Lomonosov invariant subspace theorem of compact operators.
  <br>
  <a href="files/SP24DRP.pdf"> Universal Cover of Non-positively Curved Surface</a>
  <br>
  Gave a presentation on Cartan-Hadamard Theorem and Hadamard-Lévy Theorem. Introduced enough background knowledge and emphasized the applications of covering space.

<p> Cycle
  <br>
  <a href="files/Poster.pdf"> Fundamental theorem of Riemannian Geometry</a>
  <br>
  Made a poster on smooth manifolds, tangent bundles, vector fields, Riemannian manifolds, affine connection, existence and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection,  geodesics defined by Euler-Lagrange equation and geodesics defined by affine connection, and their local consistency under Levi-Civita connection.
